# About

Heyo. I'm an incoming first-year PhD student in the [Dynamic Decision Making (DDM)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/ddmlab/) lab at Carnegie Mellon. It is an honor to be advised by the wonderful [Cleotilde Gonzalez](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/ddmlab/cotyweb/).

I was an [RSA Security Scholar](https://www.rsaconference.com/rsac-programs/security-scholar) in 2024. I also founded the [Gray Hats Cybersecurity Club](https://faculty.washington.edu/lagesse/grayhats.html) at UW Bothell.

I help organize CTFs, [defense competitions](https://www.nationalccdc.org/), [cybersecurity clubs](https://uwctf.cs.washington.edu/), and [conferences](https://www.bsidesseattle.com/). There's some really cool people in my field! 


# Academic Interests

Cybersecurity, computational cognition, game theory, psychology, ML, and Bayesian statistics. 

Also generally interested in cryptography, **usable** PETs, and quantum computing.

# Non-academic Interests

Guitar, boxing, [sustainable housing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8J15sHa8WQ), and Team Fortress 2. Also, message me about any topic - I love talking to people :)
